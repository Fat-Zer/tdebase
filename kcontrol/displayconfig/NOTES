NOTES:
1.) This loads the monitor settings quite well and even lets the user play with them, but it cannot save. or even apply the settings to hardware yet.
2.) Profile support should probably be added.  Imagine having multiple display profiles--a portable device could plug into a docking station and be set up in seconds!  The same idea applies for presentations, etc.
