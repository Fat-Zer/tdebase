*   Trinity Base API Dox.
*
* tdebase is the SVN module with the "basic applications" needed 
* for Trinity. These include starttde (a shell script to start the whole
* desktop), kdesktop (the desktop), konqueror (the browser and file-
* manager) and lots of other things. Nearly none of it has dox.
*
* KWin -- the window manager -- does have dox, as do some of
* kate's -- the text editor part -- libraries.
